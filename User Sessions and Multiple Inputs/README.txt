NOTE:
Instructor said that thank_you’s should break out of VDP_INDEX count, but the specs do not mention this. 

As a precaution, I included the output here called “nothankyoubreak.txt” where the program runs without breaking at thank_you. In order to make the program run this way, must comment out line 141-142 in ReduceClass.java
